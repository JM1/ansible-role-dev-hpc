- name: Upgrade to (unofficial) ParaView packages with patches for bug 959387, https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=959387
  apt:
    update_cache: yes
    name:
    - paraview

    state: latest

- jm1.pkg.meta_pkg:
    name: "jm1-dev-hpc"
    version: "3"
    depends:
    - libblas-dev
    - libboost-dev
    - libeigen3-dev
    - liblapack-dev
    - liblapacke-dev
    - libopencv-dev
    - libnetcdf-c++4-dev
    - libnetcdf-dev
    - netcdf-bin
    - paraview
    - paraview-dev # e.g. for compiling and linking simulation software against ParaView Catalyst
    - python3-numpy
    - python3-paraview
    - python3-pytest
    - 'libpython3.*-dev' # workaround for bug 972551, https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=972551

    # NOTE:
    # - libnetcdf-c++4-dev and libnetcdf-dev are for handling netCDF files as used for Grids in DLRs TAU
    # - paraview packages are for reading/writing and visualizing *.vtk files as produced by tau2vtk
    # - python3-vtk7 and dependent VTK packages like libvtk7-dev and vtk7-examples, have been removed because they break
    #   python3-paraview. Use VTK headers and libraries from paraview-dev instead.
    # - python3-pytest, libeigen3-dev and libboost-dev are required for pybind11 tests only
